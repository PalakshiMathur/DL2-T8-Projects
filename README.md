### MUSIC ANALYSIS & SONG RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
A unsupervised learning model which analyses the Music dataset based on different Artists, genres , acousticness,loudness , tempo etc.,and gives recommendations on the previously heard songs and playlists .



**Dataset Information**


The data set which we have used are:

**WHY?**

I created this project to see and observe the properties of music in how they affect the sound, we plot in my graph and chart for better visualizations we understand the musical patterns of a listener with their playlists as source and what factors are really useful in determining the taste and the interest of the listener.

**Libraries used**

* Pip install os
The OS library can carry out the task like creating and removing directories change the current working directory open and close files.

* Pip install numpy


Using numpy ,mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed

* Pip install pandas

pandas is a Python library that is used for fast data analysis data cleaning and data preprocessing

* Pip install seaborn

This is a data visualisation library build on the top of Matplotlib and closely integrate with pandas that structures in Python

* Pip install plotly

Plotly is used to design graph specially in interactive graphs it can plot various graphs and charts like histogram plot box plot spread plot and many more .

* Pip install matplotlib

Matplotlib is comprehensive library for creating static animated and interactive visualisation in Python

* Pip install Sklearn

Sklearn is a library in Python that is used for the purpose of implementing machine learning algorithms

* Pip install scipy

Type is used for solving mathematical scientific and engineering and technical problems it allows users to when you played the data and visualise the data

**Table of contents**

* Importing necessary libraries
* Loading data set
* Read data
* Data cleaning
* Music analysis
* Song recommendation system
* Music visualization
* Clustering with k-means


**Conclusion**

We have analysed the whole dataset we started with cleaning the data and ,then we processed EDA on dataset, then we build our song recommendation system that we have performed visualization and clustering on data set.
